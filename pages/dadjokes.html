    <p>We have been using the program codesandbox to practice react.</p>
    <p>We are creating a website the displays a dad joke when a button is clicked.</p>
    <img src= "../images/codesandbox.png" width="500px"/>
    <br>
  
    <p>First off, this is making it so we can have a max of 20 jokes that are produced when searched.
      It is also fetching the jokes from the dad jokes website that we used.
    </p>
    <img src= "../images/dadjokes2.png" width="500px"/>
    <br>
    <p>
      When we search a term (for example cow), it will show under Search Term: Cow.
    As well as, showing the list of jokes that is provided when searching the 
    key value.
    </p>
    <img src= "../images/dadjokes3.png" width="500px"/>
    <br>
    <p>
      This is the basic format of the form and shows "fetching joke" when
      waiting for jokes to be produced. As well as the search term.
